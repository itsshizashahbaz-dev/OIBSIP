 🌸 Iris Flower Classification – Oasis Infobyte Internship Task 1

 📘 Overview

This project is part of my Data Science Internship at Oasis Infobyte (AICTE Virtual Internship Program).
The goal of this task is to classify different species of the Iris flower — *Setosa*, *Versicolor*, and *Virginica* — based on their petal and sepal measurements using a (Logistic Regression) model.

 🧠 Objective

To build and evaluate a machine learning classification model that accurately predicts the Iris flower species from the given dataset.

 💻 Tools & Technologies Used

* Jupyter Notebook – for development and visualization
* Python – programming language
* Pandas – data handling and analysis
* NumPy – numerical computations
* Matplotlib & Seaborn – data visualization
* Scikit-learn (sklearn) – machine learning model and evaluation metrics

 🔍 Steps Performed

1. Importing Libraries & Dataset

   * Loaded the built-in Iris dataset using `sklearn.datasets.load_iris()`
   * Created a pandas DataFrame for easy data handling

2. Data Exploration & Visualization

   * Viewed dataset structure and statistical summary
   * Visualized feature distributions using histograms
   * Explored class balance and correlations

3. Model Building

   * Split data into **training (80%)** and **testing (20%)** sets
   * Trained a **Logistic Regression** model on training data

4. Model Evaluation

   * Predicted test data and compared with actual labels
   * Evaluated performance using:

     * Accuracy Score
     * Confusion Matrix
     * Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)
   * Visualized results using heatmaps and bar charts

5. Results

   * Achieved 100% accuracy on test data
   * Perfect classification across all three species


📈 Key Insights

* The Iris dataset is clean and well-balanced, making it ideal for beginners in data science.
* Logistic Regression is simple yet effective for small-scale, linearly separable problems.
* Proper feature scaling and visualization are essential to understanding data patterns.
